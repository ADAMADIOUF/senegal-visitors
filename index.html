                <p>Senegal, country in western Africa. Located at the westernmost point of the continent and served by multiple air and maritime travel routes, Senegal is known as the “Gateway to Africa.” The country lies at an ecological boundary where semiarid grassland, oceanfront, and tropical rainforest converge; this diverse environment has endowed Senegal with a wide variety of plant and animal life. It is from this rich natural heritage that the country’s national symbols were chosen: the baobab tree and the lion.The region today known as Senegal was long a part of the ancient Ghana and Djolof kingdoms and an important node on trans-Saharan caravan routes. It was also an early point of European contact and was contested by England, France, Portugal, and the Netherlands before ultimately coming under French control in the late 19th century. It remained a colony of France until 1960, when, under the leadership of the writer and statesman Léopold Senghor, it gained its independence—first as part of the short-lived Mali Federation and then as a wholly sovereign state.Although Senegal traditionally has been dependent on peanuts (groundnuts), the government has had some success with efforts to diversify the country’s economy. Even so, the country suffered an economic decline in the 20th century, owing in some measure to external forces such as the fall in value of the African Financial Community (Communauté Financière Africaine; CFA) franc and the high cost of debt servicing, as well as to internal factors such as a rapidly growing population and widespread unemployment.

Almost two-fifths of Senegal’s people are Wolof, members of a highly stratified society whose traditional structure includes a hereditary nobility and a class of musicians and storytellers called griots. Contemporary Senegalese culture, especially its music and other arts, draws largely on Wolof sources, but the influences of other Senegalese groups (among them the Fulani, the Serer, the Diola, and the Malinke) are also evident. Wolof predominate in matters of state and commerce as well, and this dominance has fueled ethnic tension over time as less-powerful groups vie for parity with the Wolof majority.</p>

            <p>French is the official language, but really only used regularly by a minority of Senegalese who were educated in colonial-style schools of French origin.

Most people speak their own ethnic language.
Three-quarters of the population speak the Wolof language, thereby making it the lingua franca of the country.
There are actually five other major languages: Serer, Alpuular, Mandingo, Diola, and Bassari.
Senegalese languages are primarily oral rather than written, although younger Senegalese can often write in their native language using a modified form of the Latin alphabet.
However, Muslims may use the Arabic alphabet to write in their native language.
Wolof is also spoken in Gambia and Mauritania and is the native language of the ethnic group of the Wolof people.
Like the neighbouring language Fula, it belongs to the Atlantic branch of the Niger-Congo language family.
Wolof dialects may vary between countries (Senegal and the Gambia) and the rural and urban areas.
"Dakar-Wolof", for instance, is an urban mixture of Wolof, French, Arabic, and even a little English spoken in Dakar, the capital of Senegal.

            <p><span>Hi dear travelers, Grant me just a few hours to show you the hidden wonders of such a so culturally rich country called: Senegal, or the land of hospitality.</span>
            With my company, for sure, this tour will be forever engraved in your memory and will be completely different from the ones you did before! One simple reason, I know how to do it!

My name is Sogui , a really very African name which is still echoing around the world, because of my proficiencies, my honesty and my legendary smile. If you're looking for a gifted and knowledgeable English and Spanish speaking tour guide, I'm the right choice. I'm not saying that, just to speak highly of myself, but these are the testimonies of the people I've already toured in Senegal and the Gambia.

I've got so many reasons to give, you don't know what you're loosing in not booking my services.
First I'm very fluent in English and Spanish in a french speaking country, where the great majority speaks french. This also can be certified by my university studies rewarded by a certificate of specialization in American literature and civilization.

Moreover as an African, I'm privileged and entitled to talk about some facets of our so rich culture: polygamy, marriage, circumcision, initiation, naming ceremony, the meaning of tattoos, and so on.
Some of my colleagues call me the walking encyclopaedia, the others call me professor. Because for them I was made for teaching. In my opinion, what is important is to serve my country as an ambassador of tourism, to promote it with love, knowledge, kindness, honesty, smiles and availability.
In all my services, quality is the keyword. And will be perceived first in I , myself, the vehicles, the restaurants.

If you have also partiality for history, the fauna and the flora, my tours are the right ones for you. Even for Birdwatchers , Senegal has 660 species of birds. With me let's find out birds such as:the abyssinian roller, the lizzard buzzard, the cardinal woodpecker, the red throated bee eater, the nightjars, the blue chested bee eater, the Egyptian plover, the hammerkop, the shikra, the bateleur , the carmine bee eater , the african harrier hawk, theafrican finfoot, the grey krestel , the african brown snake eagle, the klaas cuckoo, the dark chanting goshawk, and so on.
Moreover, my experience of at least 18 years as an English and Spanish speaking guide is another reason for you dear "friends " to join my tours , meaning I know how to take good care of my clients.

Even as a second year student, I was doing some off shore tours in Dakar. After being licensed as an English and Spanish speaking tour guide. I started taking the African-American around Senegal and to a small Gambian village named Juffureh, which is Kunta Kinteh forefathers origin, within the Black history month.
Later on, I went to work with all the biggest European Tour Operators present in Senegal.
When booking my services, be sure in advance that you're in good hands, and a total immersion in the local culture is guaranteed

When visiting, we'll take our time to enjoy every single minute and every single site, we'll not be running as some Tour Operators do . You'll be given the maximum time to explore and enjoy the sites.

Please keep your guide books in your bags, because What I'm saying will not be found in any guide book.
With me you're sure not to throw you money out of the window. At the end you'll realize how friendly and knowledgeable I was!!!

Welcome to Senegal!!
Your satisfaction is priority
